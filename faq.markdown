## How do I install the builds done by the automatic system?

If you only need to run your root macro on top of some prebuild
AliPhysics and you do not have access to CVMFS, which remains the
preferred, supported and recommended way of getting ALICE software, you
can try using the prebuild tarballs which you can find at:

<https://ali-ci.cern.ch/repo/TARS/&lt;architecture&gt;/dist-runtime/>

e.g., for CERN Centos 7:

<https://ali-ci.cern.ch/repo/TARS/slc7_x86-64/dist-runtime/>

(other architectures can be found in https://ali-ci.cern.ch/repo/TARS/).

If you have a RPM based distribution and you wish to try it out, please
have a look at the instructions provided here:
